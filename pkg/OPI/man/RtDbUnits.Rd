\title{Response times to white-on-white Goldmann Size III targets for 12 subjects
in dB units}
\format{
An object of class \code{data.frame} with 30620 rows and 3 columns.
}
\usage{
RtDbUnits
}
\description{
Response times to white-on-white Goldmann Size III targets for 12
subjects. The second column is the distance of the stimuli from measured
threshold in HFA dB units. The threshold was determined by post-hoc fit of FoS
curves to the data.
}
\details{
A data frame with 30620 observations on the following 3 variables.
\describe{
  \item{\code{Rt}}{Reaction time in ms.}
  \item{\code{Dist}}{Distance of stimuli from threshold in dB.}
  \item{\code{Person}}{Identifier of each subject.}
}
