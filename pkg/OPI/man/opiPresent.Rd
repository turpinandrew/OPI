A list containing

  This should include errors when the specified size cannot be achieved by

machine-specific) of the presentation until the response from the subject
if \code{seen} is \code{TRUE}.

If \code{seen} is \code{FALSE}, this value is undefined.

For kinetic perimetry on the O900, this value is unknown...}

\description{
Generic function for presentation of stimulus stim. Depending on
your choice of OPI implementation set using \code{chooseOpi()}, different
parameters are available for \code{opiPresent}
}
\details{
\code{\link{opiPresent}} is blocking in that it will not return
until either a response is obtained, or at least the responseWindow
milliseconds has expired. (Note that more time might have expired.)
Specifying \code{nextStim} allows the implementing machine to use the time
waiting for a response to \code{stim} to make preparations for the next
stimuli. (For example retargeting the projector or moving aperture and/or
filter wheels.) There is no guarantee that the next call to
\code{\link{opiPresent}} will have \code{nextStim} as the first argument;
this could be checked by the machine specific implementations (but currently
is not, I think).

Also note that to allow for different parameters depending on the
implementation chosen with \code{chooseOpi}, every parameter MUST be named in
a call to \code{\link{opiPresent}}.
\subsection{SimHenson}{
  \code{opiPresent(stim, nextStim=NULL, fpr=0.03, fnr=0.01, tt=30)}
  
  If the chosen OPI implementation is \code{SimHenson}, then the response to a
  stimuli is determined by sampling from a Frequency-of-Seeing (FoS) curve
  (also known as the psychometric function) with formula
  \deqn{\mbox{fpr}+(1-\mbox{fpr}-\mbox{fnr})(1-\mbox{pnorm}(x, \mbox{tt}},
  where \eqn{x}{\code{x}} is the stimulus value in Humphrey dB, and pxVar is
  \deqn{\min\left(\mbox{simH.global.cap}, e^{A\times\mbox{tt}+B}\right).}{\code{min(simH.cap, exp(A*tt + B))}.}
  The ceiling \code{simH.global.cap} is set with the call to
  \code{opiInitialize}, and \code{A} and \code{B} are from Table 1 in Henson
  et al (2000). Which values are used is determined by \code{simH.type} which
  is also set in the call to \code{opiInitialize}.
  
  Note that if the stimulus value is less than zero, then the Henson formula
  is not used. The probability of seeing is \code{fpr}.
  
  \code{opiPresent(stim, nextStim=NULL, fpr=0.03, fnr=0.01, tt=NULL,
                   criteria=0.95, rt_shape=5.3, rt_rate=1.4, rt_scale=0.1)}

  For determinng seen/not-seen for kinetic, the first location (to a fidelity
  of 0.01 degrees) on the path (it only works for single paths now) where the
  probability of seeing is equal to \code{criteria} is found. If no such
  location exists, then the stimuli is not seen. The probability of seeing at
  each location is determined using a frequency-of-seeing curve defined as a
  cumulative Gaussian with parameters controlled by \code{tt} and
  \code{opiInitialize}. At each location along the path, the mean of the FoS
  is taken from the \code{tt} function, which takes a distance-along-path
  (in degrees) as an argument, and returns a dB value which is the static
  threshold at that distance along the path.
  
  Function \code{tt} can return NA for not thresholds that are always not
  seen. At each location along the path, the standard deviation of the FoS
  is sampled from a Gaussion with mean taken from the formula of Henson et
  al (2000), as parametrised by \code{opiInitialize}, and standard deviation
  0.25.
  
  The location of a false positive response (for the total kinetic path) is
  sampled uniformly from the start of the path to the 'seeing' location, or
  the entire path if the stimuli is not seen.
  
  Note that the false positive rate \code{fpr} and the false negative rate
  \code{fnr} are specified for the whole path, and not for the individual
  static responses along the way.
  
  The actual location returned for a seen response is the location where the
  probability of seeing equals \code{criteria}, plus a response time sampled
  from a Gamma distribution parameterised by \code{rt_shape} and \code{rt_rate}
  and multiplied by \code{rt_scale}.That is:
  \code{rgamma(1, shape=rt_shape, rate=rt_rate) / rt_scale}.
}
\subsection{SimHensonRT}{
  \code{opiPresent(stim, nextStim=NULL, fpr=0.03, fnr=0.01, tt=30, dist=stim$level - tt)}

  For static stimuli, this function is the same as for \code{SimHenson}, but
  reaction times are determined by sampling from \code{rtData} as passed to
  \code{opiInitialize}.  The \code{dist} parameter is the distance of the
  stimulus level from the true threshold, and should be in the same units as
  the \code{Dist} column of \code{rtData}. The default is just the straight
  difference between the stimulus level and the true threshold, but you might
  want it scaled somehow to match \code{rtData}.
}
\subsection{SimGaussian}{
  \code{opiPresent(stim, nextStim=NULL, fpr=0.03, fnr=0.01, tt=30)}
  
  If the chosen OPI implementation is \code{SimGaussian}, then the response
  to a stimuli is determined by sampling from a Frequency-of-Seeing (FoS)
  curve (also known as the psychometric function) with formula
  \code{fpr+(1-fpr-fnr)*(1-pnorm(x, tt, simG.global.sd))}, where \code{x}
  is the stimulus value in Humphrey dB, and \code{simG.global.sd} is
  set with \code{opiInitialize}.
}
\subsection{SimYes}{
  \code{opiPresent(stim, nextStim=NULL)}
  
  If the chosen OPI implementation is \code{SimYes}, then the response to a
  stimuli is always yes, hence \code{\link{opiPresent}} always returns
  \code{err=NULL}, \code{seen=TRUE}, and \code{time=0}.
}
\subsection{SimNo}{

  \code{opiPresent(stim, nextStim=NULL)}

  If the chosen OPI implementation is \code{SimNo}, then the response to a
  stimuli is always no, hence \code{\link{opiPresent}} always returns
  \code{err=NULL}, \code{seen=FALSE}, and \code{time=0}.
}
\subsection{Octopus900F310}{
  \code{opiPresent(stim, nextStim=NULL)}
  
  This functions as for the Octopus900, but responses are taken from the F310
  Controller.
  
  If the L button is pressed, \code{seen} is set to 1.
  
  If the R button is pressed, \code{seen} is set to 2.
  
  If no button is pressed within \code{responseWindow}, then \code{seen} is set to 0.
}
\subsection{Octopus600}{
  \code{opiPresent(stim, nextStim=NULL)}
  
  If the chosen OPI implementation is \code{Octopus600}, then nextStim is
  ignored. If \code{eyeControl} is non-zero, as set in \code{opiInitialize},
  answer codes describing patient state may arise (see \code{answer} field
  in the Value section).
}
\subsection{KowaAP7000}{
  \code{opiPresent(stim, nextStim=NULL)}

  If the chosen OPI implementation is \code{KowaAP7000}, then \code{nextStim}
  is ignored. 
}
\subsection{Compass}{
  \code{opiPresent(stim, nextStim=NULL)}
  
  If the chosen OPI implementation is \code{Compass}, then \code{nextStim}
  is ignored. Note that the dB level is rounded to the nearest integer.
  
  If tracking is on, then this will block until the tracking is obtained,
  and the stimulus presented.
}
\subsection{DayDream}{
  If the chosen OPI implementation is \code{DayDream}, then \code{nextStim}
  is ignored.
  
  Note that the dB level is rounded to the nearest cd/\eqn{\mbox{m}^2}{m^2}
  that is in the \code{lut} specified in \code{opiInitialise}.
  
  Currently uses the most simple algorithm for drawing a 'circle'
  (ie not Bresenham's).
  
  Currently only implemented for \code{opiStaticStimulus}.
