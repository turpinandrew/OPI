#' @description Response times to white-on-white Goldmann Size III targets for 12
#' subjects. The second column is the distance of the stimuli from measured threshold
#' in 'sigma' units. The threshold was determined by post-hoc fit of a cummulative
#' gaussian FoS curve to the data for each location and subject. Sigma is the
#' standard deviation of the fitted FoS.
#' @details
#' A data frame with 30620 observations on the following 3 variables.
